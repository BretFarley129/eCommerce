This is a dummy express server setup designed to save time when setting up MEAN stack projects.

Any time this is copied to be implemented into a new project,
you need to run all npm commands:
    npm init -y
    npm install express --save
    npm install body-parser --save
    npm install path --save
    npm install mongoose --save

In addition to this, all of the Files need to be altered:

    server.js: check DB name.
        -not sure if the line is necessary but if it aint 
        broke don't fix it
    
    mongoose.js: edit DB name

    routes.js:
        -change routes names
        -change function names depending on controllers
    
    controllers and models:
        -copy both thing.js files as needed to match the number
         of models that you will be using.
        -change file names from thing.js otherwise you will be
         confuse.
        -change variable names within the files base on what I 
        wrote in there and you're good to go.
